# Calculator
Problem1:
-If we click dot once the dot button didnâ€™t set unable, we need to do that because we cant insert numbers like 82.82.123
-When we click dot first textfield should display 0. Instead of . 
-after we click dot first the ClearLast button stays disabled and we can not clear 0. From text field
Problem2:
-When we insert number for example: 52.46 and then click clear last we get 52.4, repeat operation 52. 
In this moment when we wanted to clear dot we had to click buttonClearLast twice and the textField text set to 5
